  { name: "contextual-prompts", description: "Suggest full-sentence prompt templates for the chat input based on chat history and page context (URL, title). Use when rendering the list of clickable suggested questions so the user does not have to type them manually.", instructions: "# Contextual Prompts\n\n## When to use this skill\n\nUse this skill when:\n- The sidebar chat is showing the prompt suggestion list above the input.\n- You need to decide which suggested prompts to show (e.g. generic vs Jira vs Confluence) from page URL/title and recent user messages.\n\n## How it works\n\n- **Page context**: URL and title are used to detect context (e.g. Jira, Confluence, or generic). Jira-like URLs get prompts such as \"Are there any similar Jira issues?\", \"What should I work on next?\".\n- **Chat history**: Prompts whose topic the user has already asked about are filtered out (e.g. do not suggest \"Summarize this page\" again if the user already asked for a summary).\n- **Output**: Return up to six full-sentence prompts. Each prompt is a complete question or instruction, not just keywords.\n\n## Implementation note\n\nThe actual template pool and selection logic live in `src/utils/chatPromptTemplates.ts`. This skill documents the behavior so the agent (or future LLM-based selector) knows when and how contextual prompts are used." },
  { name: "define", description: "Look up a word or phrase and return knowledge-base references (definitions, links, snippets). Use when the user double-clicks or selects a word and asks for a definition, or when the UI triggers the Define action.", instructions: "# Define\n\n## When to use this skill\n\nUse this skill when:\n- The user double-clicks or selects a word on the page and invokes \"Define\".\n- The user explicitly asks to define a term or look up references for a word.\n\n## How it works\n\n- The extension sends the selected word to a configurable Define API (Options → Define API URL). Default: `http://127.0.0.1:3001`.\n- The API returns a list of references (title, url, snippet) for that word.\n- The UI shows a popover with the references so the user can open links or read snippets.\n\n## Implementation note\n\nThe lookup is implemented in `src/core/referencesService.ts` and the optional REST server in `server/`. This skill documents when the Define feature is used so the agent can route Define actions correctly." },
  { name: "page-chat", description: "Answer questions about the current web page using RAG, page context, and optional tools (web search, page search). Use when the user asks about the page content, summary, or anything that can be found on the page or via search.", instructions: "# Page Chat\n\n## When to use this skill\n\nUse this skill when:\n- The user asks a question about the current web page they are viewing.\n- The user wants a summary, key points, definitions, or explanations of page content.\n- The user's question can be answered from page context or from a web search when page context is insufficient.\n\n## Priority order for information\n\n1. **First: Current page context** – Use the page content provided in the user message. Prefer it over web search when the answer is on the page.\n2. **Second: Training knowledge** – Use general knowledge for well-established facts that do not change over time.\n3. **Last: Web search tool** – Use only when the information is not in page context or training knowledge, or when it requires current/real-time data.\n\n## When to use web_search tool\n\nUse the web_search tool only when:\n- The information is not in the current page context.\n- The information is not in your training knowledge.\n- The query needs real-time or frequently changing data (e.g. news, prices, events).\n\n## When not to use web search\n\nDo not use web search when:\n- The answer is clearly available in the page context.\n- The question is about general knowledge that does not change.\n\n## Response requirements\n\n- Always provide a final answer that directly addresses the user's question.\n- After any tool calls, synthesize results into a clear, helpful answer.\n- Cite sources when relevant." },
